## Overview
ðŸ“Œ Today, I am pleased to announce the publication of the code for my API. This will allow interested parties to track the progress of the project and enable other developers to create their own systems.

The MovieStarPlanet2 Scammer Detection & Reporting API is a tool designed to identify and report scammers within the MovieStarPlanet2 game environment. This API utilizes verified reports from users to check if a particular user is engaging in fraudulent activities.

## Features
- Scammer identification: The API utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze verified reports and detect potential scammers based on various criteria.
- Reporting functionality: Users can report suspicious activity directly through the API, contributing to the database of known scammers and enhancing community safety.
- Customizable integration: Developers can easily integrate the API into their existing applications or services with flexible implementation options.

## Getting Started
To get started with the MovieStarPlanet2 Scammer Detection & Reporting API, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
   
if you intend to start the server with a custom uvicorn/daphne command, remove the following block from your main script:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app=app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

Use a custom uvicorn/daphne command:
```bash
uvicorn {script_name}:{app} --workers {NUM_WORKERS}
```
